# Fox Craft ðŸ¦Š
Fox Craft is a Python utility that automatically sorts files inside a folder into categorized subfolders (Images, Videos, Audio, Documents, Archives, Code, etc.). It uses [puremagic](https://pypi.org/project/puremagic/) for reliable file-type detection beyond just extensions.

## Features
- Automatically creates subfolders (Images, Videos, Audio, etc.)
- Detects file types using content-based magic numbers
- Falls back gracefully to filename extensions when needed
- Simple command-line interface (CLI)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FoxCraft.git
   cd FoxCraft

    Install dependencies:

    pip install puremagic

Usage

Run the script with the --folder argument pointing to your target directory:

python fox_file_sorter.py --folder ~/Downloads
